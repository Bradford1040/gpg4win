# The download script processes the statements here to
# actually download the packages.  The syntax is trivial:
#
# If the first non whitespace character of a line is #, the line is
# considered a comment.  If the first word of a line is "server", the
# rest of the line will be taken as the base URL for following file
# commands.  If the first word of a line is "file" the rest of the
# line will be appended to the current base URL (with a / as
# delimiter).  The statement "chk" is followed by the SHA256 checksum of
# the last file.
