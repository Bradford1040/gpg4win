# This is pretty much a brute force approach to find the icons which
# might be called from our UI apps. So anything that does QIcon::fromTheme
# is included and for Pagedialogs also the addPage.

# First we grab all the breeze icons
ICONS=$(find /usr/share/icons/breeze -name \*.svg | \
        sed 's@/usr/share/icons/breeze/.*/@@' | sed 's@.svg@@' | \
        sort -u)

# And then look through the packages which might use them
