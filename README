This is gpg4win - the GUI Installer Builder for W32.

See also the file doc/README.en.txt.

For MSI Package instructions see src/README-msi.txt.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Generate config files

   $ ./autogen.sh

3. Configure the source tree for cross compilation:

   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w32

4. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available under src/installers:

src/installers/gpg4win-X.Y.Z.exe


Instructions for AppImage:
==========================

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Generate config files

   $ ./autogen.sh

3. Build the Docker image that will be used for creating the AppImage:

   $ docker/build-appimage-docker-image.sh

4. Build the AppImage using the Docker image:

   $ docker/run-appimage-build.sh

   During development is it often easier to use

   $ docker/run-appimage-build.sh --devel

   which does not delete the temporary directory.  Inside the
   docker shell you start the build using
      src/src/appimage/build-appimage.sh


Basic requirements
==================

The recommended way to compile Gpg4win is to use docker. Alternatively
see the dockerfile in the docker subdirectory for refence which
packages are needed on which base system.

The build commands are then:

./autogen.sh
./docker/build-gpg4win-docker-image.sh
./docker/run-gpg4win-build.sh

Building the Webpages
=====================

The website is in a dedicated repository on git.gnupg.org

Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================

This requires editing a couple of files; we might eventually automate
some of these tasks.  Here is a short run up:

1. Add constants for the package FOO into src/config.nsi.in .

2. Create 2 new installer scripts, named src/inst-foo.nsi and
   uninst-foo.nsi and add them to EXTRA_DIST in src/Makefile.am.

3. Add foo to one the variables gpg4win_bpgks (if foo should not be
   build be the gpg4win) or gpg4win_spkgs (if foo should be build by
   gpg4win) in src/Makefile.am .  Also add any required configure
   flags etc.

4. Add FOO to src/inst-sections.nsi.

5. Add detection of packages to configure.ac.  Check out the available
   macros in m4/gpg4win.m4.  Depending on the way an upstream package
   is packaged, you might need to write a new macro.

6. Add download information to packages/download.sh.

7. If the package ships pkg-config (*.pc) support files, you need add
   post install instructions to Makefile.am.  Note that *.pc files may
   be in the "runtime" directory ${pkgidir} if the package is built
   within gpg4win (or peculiarly shipped), or in the development
   package ${pkgidir_dev}.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.

Installer Slideshow
===================

During installation we are showing a slide show. If you want to
change the contents shown add / modify files in the src/slideshow
subfolder. Install them in inst-gpg4win.nsi (Add them to the list
of files before g4wihelp::slide_show) and modify
src/slideshow/slides.dat accordingly.

Version numbers
===============

We use a specific order of version numbers.  This is best shown by an
example:

  2.1.1             - The final 2.1.1 release.
  2.1.1-beta88      - A snapshot before the 2.1.1 release.
                      (The 88 in this example is the number of
                       commits since the last release).

The important point is that we bump up the version number before we do
an release and append a suffix to mark it as a development version.
This allows other software to use a configure check for the next to be
released version of gpg4win.
